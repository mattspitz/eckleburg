Named for T.J. Eckleburg, this project is based on sticking an eyeball somewhere.  Except, this isn't the 20s, and the eyeball is a webcam.

This'll capture a frame every minute, watching the world from its perch.  These frames can be rolled up into movies or animated gifs.  Koyannisqatsi, look out!
